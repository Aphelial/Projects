        The mouse, sometimes called a pointer, is a hand-operated input device used to manipulate objects on a computer screen.
Whether it uses a laser or ball, or the mouse is wired or wireless, a movement detected from the mouse sends instructions to the computer to move the cursor on the screen to interact with files, windows, and other software elements.
